# Ansible Galaxy Requirements File
# Install required roles for Catalyst Center EVPN deployment
#
# NOTE: Catalyst Center roles are now available as a Git submodule in catalyst-center-roles/
# You can use roles directly from the submodule or install them via Galaxy using this file.
#
# To use roles from submodule, add to ansible.cfg:
# roles_path = ./catalyst-center-roles
#
# To install via Galaxy (alternative approach):
# ansible-galaxy role install -r role_requirements.yml
